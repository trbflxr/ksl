# How to get developer rights

To build the mod or extension for KSL you have to be a mod developer.

Currently to get the developer rights you have to join [Kino](https://discord.gg/kinomod) discord server go to the [#ksl-dev](https://discord.com/channels/716264804498538516/1130447311357612073) channel.

After obtaining the developer rights, you will have access to the **devtools** and the [control panel](https://github.com/trbflxr/ksl/blob/master/doc/guide/dev/control_panel.md) in the KSL menu.
